>## About
Project of a social-linking website developed in React and styled-components for a dentist office.<br />
This is based on a previous website I made for my personal links, and that can be found here: [MyLinks - Repo](https://github.com/giselle-ferreira/my-links) <br/>
On this one I was able to develop a more reusable, scalable and organized structure, which is the goal of React.
